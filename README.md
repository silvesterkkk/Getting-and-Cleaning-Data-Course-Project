# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

# Transformations <a name="transformations"></a>

The zip file containing the source data is located at 
[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The following transformations were applied to the source data:

1. The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
2. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e. signals containing the strings `mean` and `std`) were extracted for each measurement, and the others were discarded.
3. The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names (see [Identifiers](#identifiers) section).
4. The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. `tBodyAcc-mean()-X` was expanded to `timeDomainBodyAccelerometerMeanX`), using the following set of rules:
	- Special characters (i.e. `(`, `)`, and `-`) were removed
	- The initial `f` and `t` were expanded to `frequencyDomain` and `timeDomain` respectively.
	- `Acc`, `Gyro`, `Mag`, `Freq`, `mean`, and `std` were replaced with `Accelerometer`, `Gyroscope`, `Magnitude`, `Frequency`, `Mean`, and `StandardDeviation` respectively.
	- Replaced (supposedly incorrect as per source's `features_info.txt` file) `BodyBody` with `Body`.
5. From the data set in step 4, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Analyze the data set

The R script run_analysis.R can be used to analyze the data set. It retrieves the source data set and shape to prepare the analysis by stepping through the following steps (see the Code book for details, as well as the comments in the script itself):

Download and unzip source data if it doesn't exist.
Read data.
Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Write the data set to the tidy_data.txt file.

This script requires the dplyr & data.table package.
